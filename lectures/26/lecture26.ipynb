    "# Using Galaxy Zoo Mini for science\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've computed the vote fractions for \"Features or disk\" vs. \"smooth\" for our sample of 190 galaxies from Galaxy Zoo Mini. But why? In fact, before citizen science techniques were used, it was very difficult to select for large samples of \"smooth\" or \"disk\" galaxies without an astronomer examining each of them visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a way of getting around this, **many astronomers used (and still use!) COLOR as a proxy for galaxy morphology**. To select for \"smooth\" galaxies, redder galaxies were used, with bluer colors used to select \"disks\". This was not done with accuracy in mind; instead, color was just much easier to measure than morphology for this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, according to [Smethurst et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04507.pdf), **color is NOT a good way of selecting for galaxy morphology.** Many galaxies with red color actually have disk-like morphologies (and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
