    "* Being able to explain a concept is the ultimate test of understanding, and it's entirely possible to believe we have an understanding right up to the moment we try to explain it to someone else.\n",
    "* Therefore, asking questions during class is providing a service.\n",
    "* No feigning surprise: To enable everyone to be comfortable saying \"I don't understand\", please resist the urge to act surprised when someone admits to not knowing something.\n",
    "* No well-actually's: A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, \"well, actually...\" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation.\n",
    "* No subtle-isms: It goes without saying that overt expressions of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or other biases are unacceptable. We also need to avoid subtle expressions of bias that can make others uncomfortable and that are of no benefit to the learning environment. For example, the expression \"It's so easy my grandmother could do it\" is a subtle-ism."
